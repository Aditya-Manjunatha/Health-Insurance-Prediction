# Health-Insurance-Prediction
Will be predicting health insurance cost for individuals using a Regression model using scikit Learn for the data preperation and model .

Attaching 2 approaches :- 
* Without preprocessing of nummerical columns and dropping rows with NaN :- r2_score = 0.71
* Did imputaion and standardization of numerical columns :- r2_score = 0.18

  When you think about this, it feels weird. Cause it is a good practice to do the second approach right ?
